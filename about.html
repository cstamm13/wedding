            <div class="dumb">Everything you ever wanted to know about Bobbi and Casey</div>
        </h2>
        <p class="lead paragraph-text contact">Bobbi was about an hour and a half late to their first meeting (it was NOT a date).
            It was a Sunday in June of 2013. Bobbi had been living in Brooklyn, New York for four months and happened
            to meet Casey, born and raised in New Jersey, who has a familiarity of New York City rivaled only by
            GoogleMaps. There was really no plan to this first meeting, which was purposely referred to as a meeting
            because neither of them knew if they would ever want to hang out with one another again. There was one
            condition of this entire hangout: it needed to be kept within close proximity of a WiFi signal because Casey
            had to be available for work. <br><br>Maybe twenty minutes in to strolling the streets of the Big Apple,
            Casey received an alert from work and they had to hurry in to the nearest Starbuck’s. You could say the
            not-date
            was going swell. They sat across from one another when Casey, his spectacled eyes peering over the laptop
            screen, asked Bobbi where she’s from. “Maryland, most recently.” Casey then told a terrifying story about
            his earliest memory of Maryland, and that’s when the not-date could have easily not continued. But it did.
            They finished their beverages and when the virtual coast was clear, made their way back outside to continue
            their stroll. <br><br>Aimlessly, they walked and continuously, they talked. Casey even corrected Bobbi’s
            grammar
            at one point. They meandered their way to New York City’s High Line, a once above-ground subway track
            turned into a beautifully manicured tourist attraction, adorned with lush greenery and vibrant blooms.
            They’d strolled for quite some time before reaching the High Line and took their time once they arrived.
            Taking in the outline of the city against the pink and orange hues of the sky as the sun set, across the
            High Line they talked as they walked, and down the stairs on the other side. <br><br>Once they reached the
            landing, it happened. A kiss. Not just any kiss... Casey went in for the movie-quality two-handed
            face-grabbing
            kind of kiss. Pretty romantic, huh!? <br><br>After all that walking and talking, they decided to grab dinner
            at an adorable Italian restaurant just below the High Line. From their outdoor table they watched as the sun
            went
            down and the street lights lit up. Their dinner conversation took a turn for the hilariously grotesque when
            they reminisced about the atrocities of early Internet shock websites (and then checked to see if they still
            existed. Spoiler alert: they do). <br><br>After dinner, they walked to Bryant Park where they snagged a
            table and talked under the twinkling lights of the surrounding skyscrapers. There they sat until they got
            kicked out.
            After getting kicked out of Bryant Park, Casey got another alert for work, so they shuffled over to another
            Starbuck’s only now they were closed. Outside the Starbuck’s, Casey and Bobbi sat while Casey did the
            thing he needed to do for work. <br><br>It was after 10:00 PM on a Sunday. Even after spending eight hours
            walking and talking, neither of them were ready to call it a night, but because they both had to work the
            next
            morning, they said their goodbyes. Casey was off on his way back to Jersey, and Bobbi back to Brooklyn.
            <br><br>Casey often wonders why he waited so long for Bobbi to arrive, but he’s so happy that he did.</p>
